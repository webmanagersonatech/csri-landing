  description: `We empower women through targeted training, entrepreneurship support, financial literacy, and leadership development—an approach that has evolved through our successful implementation of women-focused programs in tailoring, digital literacy, and micro-enterprise promotion. Many of our trained women, including those from CSRI programs, have gone on to establish their own ventures or secure meaningful employment across various sectors. Their post-training achievements stand as milestones, reflecting the long-term impact of our commitment to inclusive and transformative livelihood development. Structured programs in tailoring, Aari work, digital literacy, and micro-enterprise creation. Partnerships with women’s SHGs to ensure sustainability for the women empowerment program.`,
  features: [
    "Skill-Oriented Training: Tailoring, Aari work, beauty therapy, and digital literacy courses exclusively for women.",
    "Entrepreneurship Support: Post-training handholding for women-led businesses in crafts, services, and food-based enterprises.",

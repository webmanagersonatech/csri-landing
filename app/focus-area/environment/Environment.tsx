    description: `Sona places environmental stewardship at the core of its work by encouraging green practices, climate-smart livelihoods, and community participation in conserving natural resources supported by our on-ground experience in organizing plantation drives, waste management efforts, research initiations, eco-skilling campaigns, and capacity-building programs. These efforts are further reinforced by Sona R&D Centres, which have taken deep consideration of environment-focused research and engaged in renewable energy systems, climate-smart agriculture, and green technology innovations. We integrate eco-friendly practices and climate-smart solutions into community development, ensuring both awareness and hands-on green action.`,

    description: `Through integrated development models, we adopt and support villages with interventions in skilling, healthcare, environment, and technology—drawing from our practical work in improving education, sanitation, and income opportunities in selected rural communities. Under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan scheme, we have adopted villages such as Kanderkula Manickam in the Mac'Donald Choultry (Magudanchavadi) Block and Thalavaipatty in the Salem Block, where our focused efforts in livelihood empowerment have fostered self-reliance through vocational training, micro-enterprise promotion, and community-based resource planning. Comprehensive interventions covering waste management and skill training, and women’s empowerment.`,
